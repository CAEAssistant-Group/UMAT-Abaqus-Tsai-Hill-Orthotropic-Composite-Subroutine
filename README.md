# UMAT-Abaqus-Tsai-Hill-Composite-Subroutine

✅ This is the complete source code for the project, ready to use.✨

The UMAT subroutine is a tool in Abaqus that can be used when a material cannot be adequately modeled using the Abaqus material library. In this project, we employed this subroutine to evaluate the Tsai-Hill failure criterion in composites.

One of the primary applications of UMAT in Abaqus is determining failure criteria for materials. To demonstrate this capability, we utilized a UMAT code to analyze the Tsai-Hill criterion in this project. All related files are provided for free and are available for download.

To further ensure the accuracy of our modeling, we also analyzed this 2D problem using Abaqus' built-in material model. We compared the stress distribution and the Tsai-Hill criterion results. The outcomes from both the Abaqus material model and the UMAT subroutine were identical, confirming that the code performs as expected.
